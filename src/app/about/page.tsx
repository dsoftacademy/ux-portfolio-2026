          <p>
            I am a <span className="text-zinc-950 font-medium">Senior UX Design Lead</span> with over a decade of experience crafting human-centered products for enterprise and consumer markets. My work sits at the intersection of **Design Systems Architecture**, **AI-first product strategy**, and **DesignOps**.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Currently, as a <strong>Design Lead at ICICI Lombard</strong>, I direct the UX strategy for enterprise insurance platforms. I recently led the creation of the <strong>IL Design System</strong> from scratch, unifying 15+ product teams and reducing design-to-dev handoff time by <strong>70%</strong>—earning the <span className="text-zinc-950 italic">Top Performer of the Year 2025</span> award.
          </p>

          <p>
            Previously at <strong>Jio</strong>, I drove design system maturity across one of India’s largest digital ecosystems, contributing to a <strong>17.8% increase</strong> in customer acquisition through optimized patterns.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also pioneer AI-first features, including <strong>Autonomous AI Agents</strong> and <strong>LLM-powered assistants</strong> that reduced query resolution times by 40%. My background as a <strong>Co-Founder</strong> (incubated at XLRI Jamshedpur) gives me a unique entrepreneurial lens on product growth.
